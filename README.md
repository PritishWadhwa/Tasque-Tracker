# Tasque Tracker


**Motivation:** An organization contains a lot of employees working at various levels. They range from Company Owner, Project Manager, Team Leads and General Employee. A fixed hierarchy is followed whenever any project is received by the company. The company owner gets a project from the client. He/She in turn assigns the same to a project manager. The project manager, in turn, divides the project into different sub-projects and allots them to domain-specific team leads. The team leads, in turn, have a set of domain-specific general employees who work on the tasks assigned to them by their respective team leads. All the task distribution will also have an assigned deadline by which the employee responsible for the task would have to complete it. When the employees finish their task, the person who had initially assigned it to them, reviews it and decides whether it is actually finished or not.
  
  
**Idea:** Tasque Tracker very effectively handles the process from the very top to bottom. At every stage, it distributes the tasks to the employees in a very intelligent manner. It takes into account the number of projects they are working on, and their general expertise in the domain of the project to do so.
Along with this, Tasque Tracker also provides various other functionalities such as authentication of the person using the platform, query management portal for the projects, and performance review for the employees that can be taken by their seniors in the company.
 
**Stakeholders of our project**
   
Company Owner:  The company owner will use our DBMS mainly to see all the projects undergoing in the company right now. He will also have a record of all the past projects which have been completed by the company. He will be directly dealing with the clients who will bring the project to him. At any point in time the company owner will be able to see the progress, manpower involved, project manager assigned to the project, and everything else that might be of use to him.


Project Manager:  The project manager will be responsible for all the projects currently assigned to him. He will be able to track all the activities of the current team leads working on his projects. He can assign new tasks related to the project and their respective domain and deadlines. The project manager will be responsible for updating the project progress so that the company owner can keep a track of how much the project has been completed.


The Team Leads:  There will be several team-leads assigned under a project manager and they will be responsible for their respective tasks. Each team-lead will be responsible for a particular subproject assigned to him from the project manager. The team lead will be keeping track of the activities of all the general employees, which includes their submission and their progress. He will also be responsible for reviewing the submissions made by the general employees and if he/she thinks that the submission is not good enough or is missing something, he/she can again ask the employee to work on its improvement.


General Employees:  They would be responsible for doing the real work in the company and completing the task assigned to them before the deadline.


Client:  “The actual boss”, they would be the ones who would present the team with the actual project. The client will present the company with the desired deliverables of the project and the deadline to do them.
